There is no special theory behind Notepad32 but some features are invisible like shortcuts for saving, saving as and opening files.

Shortcut keys:
		Ctrl + S - Save file
		Ctrl + N - New file

There are no keys for Opening and Saving As files, but I will add them in next version of Notepad32.
Another thing is Settings dialog. Go to Edit > Settings inside menu and there is a bunch of controls that are, well, settings.
As you can see, there is a lot of space for new settings that will be added in future like window background color, 
show and hide some controls like menu bar, status bar, etc. and other settings that  are coming in future.
For info about Notepad32 and pending bug fixing info aka. Patch Notes are available inside Help > ... menu.
Other is unneeded to explain because it looks so easy to use this program.
Ever used Notepad?
